      content="The Kythera Operating System (KOS) dynamically and
    autonomously manages next generation satellite payloads and SATCOM networks. From the
    simplest network with a single satellite, to the most complex, multi-orbit,
    heterogenous fleet of satellites with expansive capabilities for channelization, beam
    forming, and beam-hopping, KOS manages and optimizes each satellite and the broader
    fleetâ€™s resources to provision and manage satellite service. KOS dynamically adapts in
    real-time to changing service needs and operating conditions, orchestrating satellite,
    ground, and terminal resources to provide reliable, resilient satellite service. KOS
    is the brain behind the next generation SATCOM network, delivering capacity exactly
    where and when you need it."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
